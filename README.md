### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

This challenge helped me become more comfortable with responsive design and the use of CSS variables. I learned how to create a layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop screens by rearranging content based on screen size.

I also explored using CSS flexbox to structure the layout efficiently and utilized CSS variables for maintaining consistent spacing, colors, and typography throughout the project. Moreover, I experimented with rem units for font sizes and spacing, which improved the accessibility and scalability of the design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue refining my skills in responsive design, particularly in areas like grid layout and advanced media queries.

### Useful resources
